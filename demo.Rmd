# Knitr demo with python figures

This document shows how to use knitr combined with Python code blocks.

There is some setup to do for this to work. In particular,
if you are using anaconda/miniconda, the environment *must*
be locatable by your installation of RStudio.
In practice, this means that if you are using RStudio for Windows,
you likely have to install Anaconda/miniconda for Windows, and not use WSL.
At least, I was unable to get it to find a WSL version.

Once you have a conda environment installed,
you should indicate to reticulate that you want to use that environment
in your setup block.
Reticulate may also try to install a version of miniconda,
which we don't want to do in the case that it is already installed.
So a setup block might look like the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_MINICONDA_ENABLED=FALSE)
reticulate::use_condaenv("knitr")
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If you are generating matplotlib plots in RStudio desktop,
either with base matplotlib or with some of its downstream libraries
(seaborn, cartopy, pandas, geopandas, etc.),
you *may* see error messages related to Qt.
This is because RStudio is trying and failing to intercept those images
and embed them in the `Plots` pane.

You can disable this by changing the matplotlib plotting backend
to one that will not trigger this somewhat rough-around-the-edges
RStudio feature:
```{python}
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('agg')
```
For more information on this problem,
see [this](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/586) discussion.

If you are using RStudio Server, this should not be an issue.

## Matplotlib output

RMarkdown/knitr does have *some* ability to capture Python outputs,
but I found it fairly unreliable when it came to general Python code
(unsurprisingly, R integration is much better).

A more reliable way forward is to output charts to images,
then include them using regular markdown image links.
So we can create a Matplotlib figure with:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy

x = numpy.linspace(0, 10*numpy.pi, 1000)
y = numpy.cos(x)

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.savefig("mpl_fig.png")
```
![](mpl_fig.png)
Note: the most recent version of `reticulate` has a bug that makes
it not work with the most recent version of Matplotlib.
You should be able to fix it by ensuring that you have matplotlib==3.2 installed.
This should be fixed upon the next release of `reticulate`.

## Altair plots

Since altair is so web-oriented, it is probably easiest
to export to PNG or SVG, as with matplotlib, before embedding.

Exporting altair figures requires `altair_saver`,
which itself relies on nodejs or selenium to generate output.
These can be somewhat tricky to install, so if you have trouble,
you may want to use a Docker image with them pre-installed.

```{python}
import altair
import altair_saver
import pandas

source = pandas.DataFrame({
    'a': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'],
    'b': [28, 55, 43, 91, 81, 53, 19, 87, 52]
})

chart = altair.Chart(source).mark_bar().encode(
    x='a',
    y='b'
)

altair_saver.save(chart, "alt_chart.png")
```
